A printer is also one of these electronic gadgets. Printers work enormously to convert soft copies into hard by printing on paper using ink. There are two types of printers, i.e., laserjet and inkjet. Inkjet is the printer that works on liquid ink. So they are delicate and are designed for more significant and soft work, which means that they are not designed for heavy work."
